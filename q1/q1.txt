the disadvantage of this code is the usage of the anonymous function as a callback function.
It will be better the declare this function and give it a name,
and then use it as a callback function for this event
+
with the keyup event the client can press multiple keys and it will mess up the order of the event values we'll get.
you better use .change()


const keyPress = function(e){
	var topFiveSuggestions = fetchTopFiveSuggestions(e.target.val)
	showAsAutoComplete(topFiveSuggestions)
}

$("#search").change(keyPress(e){}) //shortcut of --> .on( "change", handler )
